# DORA Metrics overview

DORA(Devops Research and Assessment) Metrics.

## The 4 Metrics on Software Delivery Performances:

## 1. Deployment Frequency:

Deployment freqency tracks how often a team deploys code or new features to production/the end user.

## 2. Change Lead Time:

Change lead time tracks the time from when a developer starts writing code for a feature or a change to when that change is released to end users.

`Lead Time:` The amount of time that passes from the start of a process until it's conclusion.

## 3. Change Failure Rate:

Change failure rate is the percentage of code changes that lead to failures in production.

## 4. Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):

Mean Time to Recovery refers to the average time it takes to recover from a deployment failure (when identified) to the time until the issue is resolved/the full system functionality is restored.
